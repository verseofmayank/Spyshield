# Spyshield
## Description

**Keylogger & Network Detector** is a Python-based security tool that detects and terminates potential keyloggers and suspicious network activity. It scans running processes for known **keylogger-related keywords** and monitors **active network connections** for unusual behavior. The script ensures that critical system processes are not accidentally terminated and logs all detections in `detection.log`. Users are prompted before terminating any flagged process. This tool helps enhance system security by identifying hidden threats efficiently. 

## Features 🚀
✔ Detects keyloggers using suspicious keywords  
✔ Monitors network activity for unusual connections  
✔ Provides option to terminate malicious processes  
✔ Logs all detections in `detection.log
